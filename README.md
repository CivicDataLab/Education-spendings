# Education-spendings
This repository contains all the research work and updates regarding spendings in the education sector. 

# Background checks
According to the National Statistical Office (NSO) data analysis, access to higher education in India is much lower among socio-economically backward groups. Such insights from data is possible when we have structured data available. Thus overall spendings data had been collected from government sites in machine readable formats which then filtered out to extract spendings on the education sector. Hence this repository is created to spread more awareness among masses regarding  spendings patterns in the education sector. 

# Introduction
As we are working with the education sector, it becomes very important to define what “Education” means. Since there are records where various education related things are happening under the agriculture sector but these records do not fall under education rather it falls under the agricultural sector, so it becomes very important to figure out the most appropriate definition of “Education”. In order to achieve this, there is intensive research done which includes following steps.

# Step 1
Since it is a huge dataset that we are dealing with, it becomes easy to comprehend data if it is sorted by various features. Thus grouping has been done in order to read data more clearly which will further help in extracting most appropriate keywords which defines the term “Education” very well. 

# Step 2
In the previous filtered dataset, there was exclusion of "demand" column and inclusion of "budget", "voted_charged" and "plan_nonplan". Since we need to identify most appropriate keywords to define "Education", I am including the excluded column ie "demand" and excluding the included columns.
